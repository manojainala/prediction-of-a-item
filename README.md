# prediction-of-a-item
# The Aim of this project is to find whether the person would buy the item or not.
The 
aim 
of 
this 
case 
study 
is 
to 
predict 
whether 
the 
user 
buys 
the 
 
item 
or 
not. 
By Observing the Dataset we can say this is a classification problem 
and that too its a binary classification. By using the Machine Learning Models Like 
SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGboost,LightGBM, etc., I have solved this 
problem
